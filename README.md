Bare metal implementation  of a  UART driver for STM32 development board 
## Features
UART initialization with configurable baud rates (4800, 9600 ,115200) and peripheral clock = 8MHz.
## Requirements
### Hardware
- Discovery STM32 development board (STM32F411x series)
- Multimeter (optional for debugging)
- External LED connected to PD12 (Optional , User LED can be used)
- Bread Board (Optional if  User LED will be used)
  
### Software
- STM32CubeIDE or compatible toolchain
- RealTerm
  
## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asma-Prog-Eng/UART_Driver_STM32_F411x
   
2. Import project into STM32CubeIDE:
File → Import... → Existing Projects into Workspace

3. Update the include path directories ,  to CMSIS folder ( under Project properties -> C/C++ General -> Includes : delete existing CMSIS path directory and  add the path to CMSIS folder <br />,
   that is included in the project, : Add -> File System <br />

4. Rebuild project dependenciesFile 

## Usage
Initialization : uart_init(USART1, 4800) <br />
Transmitting Data : a character is entered through RealTerm terminal <br />
Receiving Data: uart_read(USART1)
Transmitting the receiveed Data back to RealTerm to be displayed
If key 1 is pressed , then LED is switched on
Else LED is turned off, and the entered character is send back and displayed  on the serial terminal

## Troubleshooting

No data received: <br />
- Verify baud rate settings <br />
- Check TX/RX pin connections <br />
- Ensure correct clock configuration <br />

Garbage characters: <br />
- Verify clock source accuracy <br />
- Check voltage levels <br />

## Known Limitations
